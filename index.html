      <header> What is overlanding? </header>
      <p> Overlanding describes self-reliant adventure travel to remote destinations where the journey is the primary goal. Typically, but not exclusively, accommodated by mechanized off-highway capable transport (from bicycles to trucks) where the principal form of lodging is camping; often lasting for extended lengths of time (months to years) and often spanning international boundaries. While expedition is defined as a journey with a purpose, overlanding sees the journey as the purpose.</p>

<p>Overlanding is about exploration, rather than conquering obstacles. While the roads and trails we travel might be rough or technically challenging, they are the means to an end, not the goal itself. The goal is to see and learn about our world, whether on a weekend trip 100 miles from home or a 10,000-mile expedition across another continent. The vehicle and equipment can be simple or extravagant - they, too, are simply means to an end. History, wildlife, culture, scenery, self-sufficiency - these are the rewards of overlanding.</p>

      <ul id="Trail list">
        <li> Trans-America Trail</li>
        
        <p> Motorcycle enthusiast Sam Correro developed the Trans-America Trail (TAT) in an attempt to create a coast-to-coast off-pavement motorcycle route. The TAT winds nearly 5,000 miles on a connection of dirt, forest service, gravel, and jeep roads from Southeastern Tennessee to Southwestern Oregon. On his website, Correro says the TAT is not for everyone and requires a “special ‘love’ for a motorcycle.” In 2013 a group of Land Rover LR4’s completed the route, proving that it can be done in a larger vehicle.</p>
        
        <li> The Alpine Loop Scenic Byway </li>
        <p> The Alpine Loop starts in Silverton, Colorado, and winds 63 miles through the heart of the San Juan Mountains. Nestled between highways 550 and State Road 149, the route is closed during the winter, and the high alpine environments of Engineer and Cinnamon Passes (both over 12,000 feet) require a high-clearance four-wheel-drive vehicle. The entire loop takes around four to six hours, and you’ll pass seven abandoned mining towns along the way, along with plenty of opportunities for hiking and camping. There are more challenging routes in the area, like the Black Bear Pass Road route, but if you’re looking for a mid-length overland route with spectacular mountain views in the Rockies, this is your trail. </p>
        
        <li>The Rubicon Trail</li>
        <p> There’s a reason Jeep named their most off-road worthy model of the Wrangler the Rubicon. The Rubicon Trail runs 22 miles from Georgetown to Tahoma, just west of Lake Tahoe, over slick granite and through classic Sierra Nevada scenery. This isn’t a trip for those worried about scratching their vehicle, and the Rubicon Trail Foundation recommends several vehicle modifications like larger tires and a lift kit to prevent damage. The reward for all that preparation is a few days of camping along one of the most famous overland routes in the world. 
        </p>
        <li>The Dalton Highway</li>
        <p> If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve already heard of the Dalton Highway. The mostly gravel road in Northern Alaska stretches 414 miles from Livengood to Deadhorse. It was originally built as a service road for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and is still considered one of the most dangerous roads in the U.S., mainly because of the lack of services and cell phone reception along the entire route. The payoff for braving the Dalton? You get to see some of the most spectacular wilderness in the country, traversing the Brooks Range and crossing the Yukon River en route to the Arctic Ocean. </p>
        <li>Mojave Road</li>
        <p> The 140-mile Mojave Road is a classic U.S. desert route that usually takes two to four days to traverse and requires four-wheel drive. Originally a Native American trade route and later a wagon trail, the rough and sandy track runs east to west through the Mojave National Preserve in California, crossing several mountain ranges before terminating near Barstow, California.

      <header> What is the purpose of overlanding? </header>
     <p> The purpose of overlanding is to get out and see nature. To some, this is for meditative purposes, for other it is for exploring. Overlanding has its own purpose for every individual. In essence, overlanding is exactly what you make it. However, as stated above, overlanding is empirically about the journey, not the specific destination. You will find that overlanding will become whatever you make out of it, good or bad.

    <section class="main-section" id="What_are_good_vehicles_for_overlanding?">
      <header> What are good vehicles for overlanding? </header>
      <p> Typically speaking, the best vehicles for overlanding are ones that have more advanced suspension systems, and a body-on-frame construction (over standard unibody frames). Additionally, and more importantly, the vehicle should have 4wd (4-wheel drive), or at a minimum awd (all-wheel-drive). This really helps get your vehicle out of sticky situations, and over tough obstacles. Here is a list of some of those vehicles below.
        <ul>
          <li>Toyota FJ cruiser</li>
          <li>Toyota Land Cruiser</li>
          <li>Toyota Tacoma</li>
          <li>Jeep Wrangler</li>
          <li>Jeep Cherokee</li>
          <li>Ford Raptor</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="What_are_the_risks_associated_with_overlanding?">
      <header> What are the risks associated with overlanding?</header>
      <p> The risks associated with overlanding are ones that you might initially think of. First and foremost, safety of <u>YOU</u>. Driving in areas without reception and methods of communication are nice, until you need help because you are stuck or stranded. This is why you must always prepare before leaving to keep yourself safe. 
        Additionally, the safety of your vehicle. Most car insurance companies will not cover damages to vehicles done off roading (overlanding). This means you must be careful of obstacles when driving. An accident in which you destroy something under your vehicle could become costly very quickly.
        Lastly, and sometimes forgotten, is the damaged you can do to the trails and environment. While overlanding its crucial to make sure you are not destroying the area around the trail, and leaving minimal trace of your travels. This means not tearing up the trail, not leaving your waste behind, and not disturbing the areas around the trails. This allows the recreational areas to be left open for others to enjoy. Those that have traveled the roads before you have done this for you, and it's your obligation to do the same for those that come after you.
